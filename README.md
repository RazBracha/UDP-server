# UDP-server
This Time Server is a simple UDP server programmed in C++ using the Winsock library. It listens for incoming requests from clients and responds with various time-related information based on the client's request.

The server creates a UDP socket and binds it to a specific port. It then waits for incoming datagrams from clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the server processes the request and sends back the appropriate time-related information.
